# Game Code 

> Information regarding game developers and conferences.

> **Gamescom** describes itself as a ‘gaming festival’ – which means plenty of chances to try out new releases, meet and greet with big names in the industry, and hang out with professionals and enthusiasts alike. 

> **Devcom** is Gamescom’s official game developer event. It started as just a way to group together all of the talks and showcases aimed at devs, but quickly grew into a must-attend conference in its own right. 

> **Tokyo Game Show** boasts exhibitions, demos and talks from pretty much every major studio, console maker and game development services provider you can think of, plus one of the world’s biggest cosplay gatherings. 

> **Meaningful** Play describes itself as a conference about ‘theory, research and game design innovations, principles and practices.’ It’s smaller than the first two conferences in this list, but a potential goldmine for any devs who want to get better at building meaningful games – whether that’s making them more educational, more entertaining, or just more supportive of players’ needs.

> **Unite** is run by Unity, one of the world’s biggest game engines, and it’s designed to bring together ‘guest speakers, thought leaders, and the people behind some of your favorite Unity games, experiences and features’. The conference is designed specifically to bring game devs and Unity enthusiasts from across the industry together to share knowledge, network and keep up with the latest news on one of the world’s biggest game development engines.
